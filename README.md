## Foldie

> the random folder generator

Tired of making folders? Let foldie make them for you.

Run the command:

```
 foldie make
```

And foldie will tell you what folder it has made!

_foldie will make a folder in whichever directory it was ran from_

## About

This was a small morning project to get the brain juices running and to solve a very minor problem of being creative with folder names. Minimal testing has been done, but I plan to make foldie the best doohicky it can be!
