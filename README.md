## Foldie

> the random folder generator

Tired of making folders? Foldie will take a random food and a random animal and make that folder for you.

Installation:

```
npm i -g foldie
```

Use:

```
 foldie make
```

Don't want to install and have npm > 5.2?

```
npx foldie make
```

Foldie will tell you what folder it has made!

```
foldie made tartar_avocet
```

_foldie will make a folder in whichever directory it was ran from_

## About

This was a small morning project to get the brain juices running and to solve a very minor problem of being creative with folder names. Minimal testing has been done, but I plan to make foldie the best doohicky it can be!
